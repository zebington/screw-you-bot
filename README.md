# Screw You Bot
A Discord bot that uses robbietherobot.com to generate insults and shout them at your friends!

## Usage
Create an `auth.json` file, containing the line `{"token":YOUR API TOKEN}`, or create an environment variable named `DISCORD_API_KEY` with the value set to your API token.

Run the bot using `node bot.js`.

Run the command in chat using `!insult *target1* *target2*...*target n*`. You don't have to use a target, but that let's you personalize your outrage!
